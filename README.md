# Aloalonzonzo

This project was developed by Christopher Schankula and Dennis Zvigelsky in partial fulfillment of the [CAS 760](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=25&coid=143613)
course requirements.

## Overview

Aloalonzonzo is an encoding of the syntactic aspects of William Farmer's logic [Alonzo](https://www.amazon.ca/Simple-Type-Theory-Expressing-Mathematical/dp/3031211111/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CTGSN2O0HG3E&keywords=william+m+farmer+simple+type+theory&qid=1670878026&sprefix=william+farmer+%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-1)
within its own set of theory definition modules.

## Theory Definition Modules

A typical *theory definition module* is a tuple that has the following:
- Module name
- Base types
- Constants
- Axioms

One module that was used extensively in Aloalonzonzo was the *theory extension module*. It has the following:
- Module name
- Name of sub-theory
- New base types
- New constants
- New axioms

## Syntax Specified

The following syntactical properties of Alonzo were specified:
- Strings
- Types
- Expressions
- Bound Variables
- Free Variables
- Expression Substitutions
